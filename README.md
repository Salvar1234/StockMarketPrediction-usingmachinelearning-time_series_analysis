  # ** Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning -time series analysis.**

  ### Project Introduction :

  An important characteristic of the stock market is that it is a dynamic system characterized by high levels of volatility meaning that making a clear prediction of trends is difficult. The problem focus under consideration in this research relates to stock market analysis. It is mainly concerned with the use of machine learning to predict trends in the stock market using time series data. It seeks to use historical data and modelling tools to identify trends and improve on predictive and prognostic analysis. Offering the chance to surpass conventional approaches, the employment of machine learning constitutes an opportunity. All these help the investors to make better decisions, reduce or avoid risks, and maximise returns in the ever-fluctuating stock markets.
The stock market trading started in 1611 by the Dutch East India Company was the only existing market for many years and has since expanded to become a global market. The forecast of the stock market movement then emerged towards the end of the last century with the development of statistical or time series analysis. However, the analysis of stock movements continues to prove difficult because of the inherent unpredictable and dynamic character of the stock market.
In the future, global online trading has been projected to rise at a global compounded annual growth rate of 6.4% per year and is expected to reach US 13.3 Billion in 2026. This growth underlines the idea that the issue of stock forecast becomes critical, as investors take high risks relying on their guesswork. By employing time-series analysis with the help of ML algorithms, one can overcome the mentioned difficulties. These algorithms may make use of past data to forecast additional features of stock prices and evaluate real-time market conditions. For example, at the beginning of 2022, about 60% of the trading from the US equities was attributed to automated trading and hence, the need for better predictive models. Furthermore, it aims to offer a basis for the selection of relevant factors, algorithms and features dependably for developers of financial technology that would improve the efficacy of the stock price prediction.
The rationale of the research is to analyse the ever-changing market trends, investors are in constant search for the most accurate prediction models to reduce risks of investment and also to maximize profits. Based on time series data analysis using machine learning techniques this research seeks to establish the best models fit for forecasting stock prices. As the market tends to produce unpredictable situations it is crucial to improve the efficiency of forecasts and investorsâ€™ decision-making. Further, it supports the creation of stable financial technologies through the determination of the most fitting models for the predictability of the stock market in the future. The main aim of this project will be to develop a software model that is based on LSTM, XG Boost and Random Forest algorithms. Then, the performance of these models will be compared based on effective model evaluation techniques mainly to find the best algorithm for predicting stock prices.
